      "title": "Fishing on an Iced lake",
      "description": "For some laid back winter recreation, consider ice fishing for wakasagi. Wakasagi, or Japanese pond smelt, can be found in large shoals under frozen lakes. Just cut a hole in the ice, put your bait in and wait for these easy-to-catch fish to bite. This activity is fun for adults, children, first-timers and experienced fishers alike. After a day on the lake, enjoy your catch deep fried for lunch or dinner.\n\nAlthough you will need a rod, reel, bait and a basic tackle kit, they are all available for rent in most fishing spots. However, you should bring gloves and towels, and come dressed for the freezing temperatures.\n\nThere are plenty of places in Japan you can try wakasagi fishing each winter. Visit Lake Yamanaka (Yamanashi) for the quintessentially Japanese experience of ice fishing under the backdrop of Mt. Fuji. Other popular, picturesque wakasagi fishing spots include Lake Abashiri (Hokkaido), Lake Akan (Hokkaido), Lake Gando (Iwate), Lake Hibara (Fukushima) and Lake Suwa (Nagano).",
